/// gigabyte. This used to copy the blob into a MemoryStream that doubles as it grows, call <c>ToArray</c> on it and
/// hand the copy on — two full copies alive at once, and alive for the length of the whole analysis rather than
/// the upload, because the local outlived the call that used it.
///
/// Opus is stored on disk and PCM is what everything reads, so the two cases are genuinely different. A WAV needs
/// no decoding and therefore need not be in memory at all: the blob's own stream goes straight to the upload. Opus
/// does — a decoder needs the whole file — but it is about a tenth the size going in, and the decoded side is now
/// built once, into a buffer sized for it, rather than three times.
