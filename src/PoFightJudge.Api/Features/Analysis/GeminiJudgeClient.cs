/// <c>400 INVALID_ARGUMENT</c> from every judge request. Bisecting the schema against the live endpoint found a
/// complexity ceiling on <c>responseSchema</c>: one player assessment (27 properties) is accepted, and the same
/// schema with a second player carrying 14 of them is not. The documentation says only that "very large or deeply
/// nested schemas may be rejected", and <c>$ref</c> is rejected outright by this API, so there is no way to declare
/// the assessment once and use it twice. One player per call is what fits.
///
/// The two assessments share a long identical prefix — the instructions, the recording and the session data —
/// and only the trailing task line differs. That prefix is uploaded once as a cachedContents resource and both
/// calls name it, which buys the discount outright instead of hoping the provider's implicit cache is still warm,
/// and lets the two go out together rather than one behind the other. Explicit caching has a minimum token count
/// a very short fight may not reach, so a refused cache falls back to the inline requests unchanged.
///
/// The ruling stays separate: it is cheap, it needs no audio, and folding it back in is what overran the output
/// ceiling when this was one monolithic call.
